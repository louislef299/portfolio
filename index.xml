Going to focus more on just keeping some
notes online about any research I do, travel and any other interests I have.
I&amp;rsquo;ve never really been great at writing, but it would be great to just have a
linear blog to keep track of everything I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently working at Medtronic as a platform engineer and have slowly evolved
into a jack-of-all-trades engineer with more of a pioneer&amp;rsquo;s mindset with
innovation and business/customer buy-in before industrialization and
stabilization.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Welcome</title><link>https://louislefebvre.net/travel/welcome/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>louislefebvre1999@gmail.com (Louis Lefebvre)</author><guid>https://louislefebvre.net/travel/welcome/</guid><description>&lt;p>So I&amp;rsquo;ve marked up a little map to identify where I&amp;rsquo;ve been and about when. It
doesn&amp;rsquo;t cover everything, but it at least covers the basics of where I&amp;rsquo;ve been.
A few tropical areas, lots of mountains, across the pond, all over. Very
grateful to have the opportunity to travel so much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the most impactful trips that I actually took good notes on was my
California trip last year(2023). It was just me that went, but I was pretty much
in between San Francisco and Los Angeles the whole time bumming around and
surfing. It was a blast! Luckily I got so bored that I started noting &lt;a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/hqKRLNXjLXdGLLt17">where I
went on Google Maps&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
