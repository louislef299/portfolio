balance getting actual work done while massaging different egos to win political
favor. Anyways, most of the work that I&rsquo;ve laid down is ready for somebody to
take action on, but I&rsquo;ve decided to focus more on my side projects in my free
time for now as long as my company doesn&rsquo;t think my efforts are worth their
time.</p><p>So, an update on some of my bluetooth programming: since the Go DBus programming
has been a grind and I would have to basically invent a whole new library just
to work with it, I&rsquo;ve decided that I should move back to a more naturally
embedded language. This decision came with the realization that I would likely
want more control over my application code when working with bluetooth to make
it more performant and reliable.</p><p>Initially, I figured I&rsquo;d go back to C, because most of the libraries I need are
written in C and I do enjoy some of the programming concepts that were inherited
from C to Go that improve overall language stability. The difficult parts of
writing in C revolved around thread and memory management, however, and had some
features that contributed to overly-complex code.</p><blockquote><p>Clear is better than clever &ndash; <a href=https://go-proverbs.github.io/>Rob Pike</a></p></blockquote><p>Then I started to toss around the idea of getting back into C++ or Rust, but it
was a tough idea to swallow just because those languages are known to have a
steep learning curve and I just wanted to mess around with bluetooth for fun.
Then, I ran into <a href=https://ziglang.org/>Zig</a>.</p><p>What I found the most appealing about it was it solved some of the more complex
memory allocation problems, while also allowing for cross-compiling with
existing C code&mldr; perfect for my use case! This way I can work with a more
modern programming language while using old libraries that hadn&rsquo;t yet been
migrated over to Zig(maybe I could eventually contribute?).</p><p>Anyways, I just wanted to give a quick update on where I&rsquo;m at here since it has
been a while. Most of what I&rsquo;ve been doing is <a href=https://www.openmymind.net/learning_zig/>learning Zig</a> when I have time
and doing boring projects to get used to the language. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll have an
updated <a href=https://github.com/louislef299/rmt>rmt</a> project that is fully written in Zig by the end of the month.</p><p>Until then, happy Spring!üåû</p></content><p></p><p><a href='mailto:louislefebvre1999@gmail.com?subject=Reply%20to%20"May%20Update"'>Reply to this post by email ‚Ü™</a></p></main><footer><small>2023 Louis LeFebvre | Made With ‚ù§Ô∏è and <a href=https://clente.github.io/hugo-bearcub/>·ï¶ ï ‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î·ï§</a></small></footer></body></html>
