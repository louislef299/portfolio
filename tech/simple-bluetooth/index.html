spent some time learning the basics of bluetooth and made a super simple
central and peripheral example in Go. Now, I am trying to encapsulate other
packets into bluetooth packets, and I will cover that journey with this post.
Going over the simple example
The central peripheral code can be found in my ble-playground repository.
It&rsquo;s pretty simple and doesn&rsquo;t do anything special, so I&rsquo;ll skip an in-depth
description and instead give this high-level diagram of what it does:"><meta name=author content><meta name=keywords content><meta property="og:url" content="https://louislefebvre.net/tech/simple-bluetooth/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Louis Lefebvre"><meta property="og:title" content="Communicating Information Abusing Bluetooth in Go"><meta property="og:description" content="Just going to go over communicating over bluetooth in Go.

back and forth using concepts called Services and Characteristics. GATT is
important to consider when a connection is established between two devices that
have already gone through the advertising process governed by GAP.</p><p>Only one peripheral device can be connected to a central at a time using GATT,
meaning that any advertising that had happened prior to GATT will not continue.
This connection then allows for two-way communication between devices.</p><p>GATT Servers(Peripherals) and Clients(Centrals) negotiate a connection interval
to transact data. This interval is just a recommendation, however, not a
requirement. The GATT transactions contain nested objects called <a href=https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/>Profiles</a>,
