bluetooth.

back and forth using concepts called Services and Characteristics. GATT is
important to consider when a connection is established between two devices that
have already gone through the advertising process governed by GAP.</p><p>Only one peripheral device can be connected to a central at a time using GATT,
meaning that any advertising that had happened prior to GATT will not continue.
This connection then allows for two-way communication between devices.</p><p>GATT Servers(Peripherals) and Clients(Centrals) negotiate a connection interval
to transact data. This interval is just a recommendation, however, not a
requirement. The GATT transactions contain nested objects called <a href=https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/>Profiles</a>,
<a href=https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/assigned-numbers/>Services and Characteristics</a>.</p><p><img src=/image/microcontrollers_GattStructure.png alt="Profiles, Services, and Chars"></p><h2 id=going-over-my-simple-example>Going over my simple example</h2><p>The central peripheral code can be found in my <a href=https://github.com/louislef299/ble-playground>ble-playground</a> repository.
It&rsquo;s pretty simple and doesn&rsquo;t do anything special, so I&rsquo;ll skip an in-depth
description and instead give this high-level diagram of what it does:</p><pre tabindex=0><code class=language-ascii data-lang=ascii>┌──────────────────┐            ┌──────────────────────┐

using <a href=https://www.bluez.org/>bluez</a> and uploaded the Go binary with <code>scp</code>.</p><h2 id=where-do-i-want-to-go>Where do I want to Go?</h2><p>In a separate post, I would like to have a cylic TCP=>Bluetooth=>TCP
relationship between my computer and the pi5. It helps understand how to allow
the peripheral node to act as a sort of gateway to the central(where I need to
understand this architecture and how this ble interest started).</p></content><p><a class=blog-tags href=/tags/go/>#go</a>
