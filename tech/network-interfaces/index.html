Wireguard&rsquo;s TUN interface
Setting Up
The TUN interface is created at /dev/net/tun and represents the tunnel
used to communicate with the external service. When running through
Cloudflare&rsquo;s Understanding TUN/TAP, it made more sense that this TUN
device represented a local point-to-point connection with the Wireguard
service. Found this fun rhyme to remember the difference between the device

used to communicate with the external service. When running through
Cloudflare&rsquo;s <a href=https://blog.cloudflare.com/virtual-networking-101-understanding-tap/>Understanding TUN/TAP</a>, it made more sense that this TUN
device represented a local point-to-point connection with the Wireguard
service. Found this fun rhyme to remember the difference between the device
types:</p><blockquote><p>Tap is like a switch,<br>Ethernet headers it&rsquo;ll hitch.<br>Tun is like a tunnel,<br>VPN connections it&rsquo;ll funnel.<br>Ethernet headers it won&rsquo;t hold,<br>Tap uses, tun does not, we&rsquo;re told.</p></blockquote><p>To see Wireguard create the TUN interface, a lot of the code in <code>FirstExample()</code>
is pulled directly from the <a href=https://github.com/tailscale/wireguard-go>Wireguard Mirror</a>&rsquo;s <code>main.go</code> function. See the
example with the following:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#75715e># In one terminal, run FirstExampe() to create the TUN interface:</span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>sudo go run main.go
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#75715e># Then in another terminal, view the TUN interface using iproute2:</span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#75715e># (Should output louis0: tun vnet_hdr)</span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>ip tuntap list
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>ip -s link show dev louis0</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When the device is being setup, Wireguard goes through the following
stages:</p><ol><li>Open <code>/dev/net/tun</code> to request new interface device</li><li>Generate a new device request through <code>ioctl()</code>(OS dependent) with flags</li><li>Send <code>ioctl()</code> device request</li><li>Set file descriptor to non-blocking</li><li>Create a new file from fd to <code>/dev/net/tun</code>??</li><li>Create the TUN from the generated file => the NativeTun is the software interface used to interact with the application</li></ol><h3 id=understanding-nativetun>Understanding NativeTun</h3><p>TODO</p><p>Will want to understand how Wireguard actually interacts with TUN
once created. Will be a bit different than the TAP document, but
should be able to pull references from there and Tailscale.</p><h2 id=references>References</h2><ul><li><a href=https://lightyear.ai/blogs/point-to-point-leased-lines-p2p-vs-wavelength-circuits>Point-to-Point topology</a></li><li><a href=https://docs.kernel.org/networking/tuntap.html>Linux TUN/TAP Networking</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/tailscale/wireguard-go>Wireguard Mirror</a></li><li><a href=https://blog.cloudflare.com/virtual-networking-101-understanding-tap/>Understanding TUN/TAP</a></li><li><a href=https://copyconstruct.medium.com/nonblocking-i-o-99948ad7c957>File descriptor deep dive</a></li><li><a href=https://backreference.org/2010/03/26/tuntap-interface-tutorial/>TUN/TAP Interface Tutorial</a></li></ul></content><p></p><p><a href='mailto:louislefebvre1999@gmail.com?subject=Reply%20to%20"Playground%20for%20Network%20Interfaces"'>Reply to this post by email ↪</a></p></main><footer><small>2023 Louis LeFebvre | Made With ❤️</small></footer></body></html>
