Over the summer, I had
spent some time learning the &lt;a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/introduction-to-bluetooth-low-energy/gap">basics of bluetooth&lt;/a> and made a super simple
central and peripheral example in Go. Now, I am trying to encapsulate other
packets into bluetooth packets, and I will cover that journey with this post.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The central peripheral code can be found in my &lt;a href="https://github.com/louislef299/ble-playground">ble-playground&lt;/a> repository.
It&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple and doesn&amp;rsquo;t do anything special, so I&amp;rsquo;ll skip an in-depth
description and instead give this high-level diagram of what it does:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Welcome</title><link>https://louislefebvre.net/tech/welcome/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>louislefebvre1999@gmail.com (Louis Lefebvre)</author><guid>https://louislefebvre.net/tech/welcome/</guid><description>&lt;p>Alright so I&amp;rsquo;ve slimmed things down. Going to focus more on just keeping some
notes online about any research I do, travel and any other interests I have.
I&amp;rsquo;ve never really been great at writing, but it would be great to just have a
linear blog to keep track of everything I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently working at Medtronic as a platform engineer and have slowly evolved
into a jack-of-all-trades engineer with more of a pioneer&amp;rsquo;s mindset with
innovation and business/customer buy-in before industrialization and
stabilization.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wireless Interface Information using nl80211/Arch Install</title><link>https://louislefebvre.net/tech/nl80211/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>louislefebvre1999@gmail.com (Louis Lefebvre)</author><guid>https://louislefebvre.net/tech/nl80211/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just copying this over from one of my previous projects. It goes over my
experience with low-level network programming using Linux network interfaces and
Go. Along the way, I was having issues battling &lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Tools/NetworkManager">Network Manager&lt;/a> when I had
Fedora Linux installed, so I switched over to Arch and decided to just use
&lt;a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Iwd">iwd&lt;/a> instead. It has proven to be must better in my experience and
essentially remains out of the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Guess what? Not a whole lot of documentation for nl80211! Yayyyyy :)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CCNA Journey - Introduction to TCP/IP Networking</title><link>https://louislefebvre.net/tech/ccna-chp1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2024 14:17:49 -0600</pubDate><author>louislefebvre1999@gmail.com (Louis Lefebvre)</author><guid>https://louislefebvre.net/tech/ccna-chp1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Chapter 1 starts off with getting some initial perspectives on networking down
as a general introduction. This was all really review as they just talked about
the different ways and individual or enterprise connect to a network and through
which mediums.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After an initial network introduction, the reading went into the TCP/IP
networking model and the history of the initial battle between the OSI model and
TCP/IP. The important historical value to note is that in the late 1970s and
early 1980s, the OSI model looked to be the model that would win out. That is
why you see lots of documentation still reference &amp;ldquo;Layer 7&amp;rdquo; protocols even
though the TCP/IP model won out and only technically has 5 layers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Playground for Network Interfaces</title><link>https://louislefebvre.net/tech/network-interfaces/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>louislefebvre1999@gmail.com (Louis Lefebvre)</author><guid>https://louislefebvre.net/tech/network-interfaces/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just messing around with network interfaces in an attempt to understand
some of the low-level OS fundamentals. I was led in this direction when
looking at Wireguard&amp;rsquo;s packages and getting a fun,system-level example of
how to run system calls and file descriptors to configure network interfaces
in Go.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wireguards-tun-interface">Wireguard&amp;rsquo;s TUN interface&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Referenced code can be found &lt;a href="https://github.com/louislef299/go-scripts/blob/main/projects/network-interfaces/main.go">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="setting-up">Setting Up&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The TUN interface is created at &lt;code>/dev/net/tun&lt;/code> and represents the tunnel
used to communicate with the external service. When running through
Cloudflare&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/virtual-networking-101-understanding-tap/">Understanding TUN/TAP&lt;/a>, it made more sense that this TUN
device represented a local point-to-point connection with the Wireguard
service. Found this fun rhyme to remember the difference between the device
types:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
