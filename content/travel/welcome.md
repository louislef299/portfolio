So I've marked up a little map to identify where I've been and about when. It
doesn't cover everything, but it at least covers the basics of where I've been.
A few tropical areas, lots of mountains, across the pond, all over. Very
grateful to have the opportunity to travel so much.

One of the most impactful trips that I actually took good notes on was my
California trip last year(2023). It was just me that went, but I was pretty much
in between San Francisco and Los Angeles the whole time bumming around and
surfing. It was a blast! Luckily I got so bored that I started noting [where I
went on Google Maps][Cali2023].

Other than that, some spring breaks, family trips and a study abroad were all
sprinkled in there. Currently, I've been watching Stoney Point up in the North
Shore on Lake Superior and have been hoping to surf it this winter. I'll be sure
to write up a post if I do that and maybe even get some pictures.

As much as I love traveling, I wouldn't say I enjoy it to just lay around and
relax. Sure I enjoy that every once in a while, but I more prefer the long road
trips across the country, wild backpacking camps up north, searching for the
best breaks on the coasts, or getting wind burn after summiting a mountain.

Anyways, I'll try to write up blog posts about that places I've been, some of
the best restaurants I hit or some things that I did. I'm not going to go over
any of my previous trips more than marking them on the map, but I'll try to
write about them a bit.
