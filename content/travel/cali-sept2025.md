Just got back from a great road trip from San Francisco to San Diego with my
friends Dan and Cash. It was so much fun from watching the Gophers lose to
kicking it with [Rudie][] at his coffee shop to getting hammered by a sunset
surf in San Diego, this trip was truly unforgettable.

When I landed in San Francisco on that first Friday, my friend Luke who lived
there was nice enough to pick me up and we went right to a Taco Bell Cantina to
catch up over some beers and a taco. One of the nicest views I'd ever had at a
tbell! But he was telling me all about the startup that he was a part of after
he had left Anduril and it was a blast hearing about the high-octane tech life
in Silicon Valley.

Another highlight of San Francisco had to have been this Brazilian Cafe; [Cafe
de Casa][]. If you go, please do yourself a favor and get the Rosca de Coco. It
was one of the best rolls I'd ever had.

When we were driving from Monterey, we had to check out Big Sur. It was too bad
that the 1 was closed about halfway through the drive(which Rudie had to tell us
meant we missed the best parts), but we were able to stop at Pfeiffer Beach and
it would really be a treat to go back there. It felt a lot like some of the
national parks Elise and I had just been to on our Jackson Hole trip with all of
the cabin stays you could rent out.

The whole time the music we were playing was awesome. Lots of alt and indie that
was played. I tried to capture the vibe with a little bit of my own taste in
there:

This whole trip was a blessing to share some of my favorite spots in California
that I had discovered when I did my 3 month solo road trip back in 2022. Coming
back, it felt like home as I had been to San Diego and Oceanside multiple times
at this point and had really fallen in love with Northern Cali when I was road
tripping.

Luckily, I had traveled with my 6'6" board and was able to get a lot better at
actually catching waves with it(no footage of me actually catching a wave lol)
and my time on my prone paddleboard back home had paid off. My timing and wave
positioning were much better and I was catching a lot more waves with a lot less
board. Now, I just need to work on my edges and start carving up the wave a bit
more... I'm thinking I'll try to snowboard a bit more this winter to get some
practice. All eyes are up north this winter too to try and catch some waves on
superior. Maybe I'll create a wave report for the site or something...

Anyways, having Cash and Dan on the trip was perfect. A small enough group where
we could easily agree on things to do and chill guys that would go with the flow
of my from-the-hip travel planning style.
