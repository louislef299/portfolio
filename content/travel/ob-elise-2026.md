Ya what about it? After ripping my way through RDR2 and watching Dolly for a
week and Elise coming fresh off of a trip to Spain, we set out to OB for a
week of spring break. Getting a surfer's journal subscription was a mistake. You
can't help but look at some of the best surfing destinations in the world and
just think "why tf am I just laying on my couch". So, this was a bit of a
spontaneous trip, but it lined up perfectly for Elise and my 2 year
anniversary🎉😘.

We landed in San Diego around 5PST and, as is tradition, grabbed some BBQ on
Newport Ave. That next morning I woke up and got my ass kicked by the
ocean(before the morning coffee). I'd been swimming to prep for this trip, but
coming off of 6 months without surfing to 10ft+ waves is rough on the shoulders!
That called for breakfast sandwiches & coffee from [Benedict's][] which, pro
tip: split the sandwich if there's two of you... they're huge.

Afterwards, the weather picked up, with increasing winds gusting >30 knots, so
we hunkered down and watched movies until our reservation that night. We went to
[Herb & Wood][] and damn it was good! Great way to celebrate an anniversary or
special occasion if you're in the area.

The next few days, we made the most of the bad weather. We coffee shop hopped as
Elise worked remotely and I was experimenting with Google's ADK(hopefully more
to come to the site on that front). Funny enough, on Ash Wednesday it started to
lighten up and we hiked in the suburban hills of OB before coming back down and
hitting the farmer's market. We ran into this guy who printed album covers on
wood coasters(4 for $20) and we had to grab some for our Dads. Elise got almost
all Rolling Stones albums and Big T got Bobby D, Beatles, Metallica and
Megadeth🤘.

On Thursday, we hit Balboa Park☂️. While the sun was out, we walked around as
much of the north-eastern part of the park as possible; observing different
kinds of cactuses, trees(including the massive Moreton Bay Fig tree!) and
theaters, eventually running into the [Village Arts Center][]. Elise could have
spent all day with those artists, but the weather turned and we went into the
Timken Museum of Art to look at some paintings.

With a break in the rain, we went to the Botanical Building then hiking through
Palm Canyon to our final destination for the day, the Air & Space Museum. We'd
gotten lucky the whole day and were able to time the rain, but the weather
really was starting to pick up again and we retreated back to the airbnb.
Needless to say, this whole time I was itching to surf, but the water quality is
miserable when it rains, so there was no way I was going to get into that with
strong rip currents and tiny swell periods.

The next morning, the winds were still strong from the storm the night before,
creating really choppy waves and strong rip currents. Again, nobody was out
there and I was still cautious about the water quality, so I grabbed us coffees
at Daybreak Cafe and got a rental car. First order of business? Go to La Jolla
Shores to check out the surf conditions as it seemed to be the most promising
conditions for the day.

When we got there, the waves were small and calm, but so calm I would have
needed a foamy or at least a longboard to catch them. I'd brought my short board
and my new fish board, so that was going to be a no... for now. We wound up
stumbling on the La Jolla coastal trail though! Turned out to be a gorgeous day
too as we breathed in the fresh air from Matlahuayl State Marine Reserve. After
shopping around, eating at The Cove, and walking for miles, we looped back down
to the car to find some sunset surf! So I took out the board and grabbed some
slush.

The next morning, I made sure to wake up at 6 to go grab coffee and hit the
beach for an OB surf morning! Conditions were solid and they were going to taper
off as the day wore on so the early bird got the worm Saturday. I wound up being
out for hours, there were so many waves to catch and didn't come in until lunch.
We then scarfed down some left-over pizza from Luigi's and headed for Del Mar,
which I had never spent a significant amount of time in.

We parked a little north in town and were preoccupied with the boutiques,
cafes and exploring for the rest of the afternoon. Before calling it a day, we
hit Torrey Pines State Beach for a sunset surf to try out the new fish board.
The waves were very weak and really only for longboards, but I couldn't come
home without at least catching a couple waves on it! The other sessions I was a
little nervous to bring it out since the surf was so sparse, I didn't want to
risk not being used to the smaller board and wasting the waves. But, I really
wish I had brought it out before. The paddling and handling was super similar to
my 6'6" albeit way less buoyant, but the rails were a lot sharper and I was able
to carve on the wave way better (for as short of a ride as the waves were). It
made me really want to try it out on Superior, although I'll also have my 9'
longboard too.

Once I'd had enough, we raced to the lavender coastal walk to hike around for a
couple miles and watch the sunset. After a big day, we went to Culture Brewing
to eat some kick-ass BBQ and have a beer. They had amazing brisket & pulled pork
sliders that we inhaled, followed with a cinnamon roll slider😋.

The final morning, the waves were pretty weak, again. I was pretty spent, but
there was a high school surf competition going on, so Elise and I got breakfast
and watched them a bit. We had to end it with the Blanco-y-Blanco espresso from
Day Break Cafe and some breakfast sandwiches. Then, we cleaned up the airbnb,
packed up the car and decided to get a final hike on La Jolla Shores one more
time before heading to the airport.

All in all, Elise and I had a great trip and man do I wish we could have (would
have?) spent another week there. I definitely left with a hunger to catch some
more waves and experiment, so all eyes are going to be up north for the
remainder of the winter.
