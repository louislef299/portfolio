Alright so I've slimmed things down. Going to focus more on just keeping some
notes online about any research I do, travel and any other interests I have.
I've never really been great at writing, but it would be great to just have a
linear blog to keep track of everything I've been working on.

Currently working at Medtronic as a platform engineer and have slowly evolved
into a jack-of-all-trades engineer with more of a pioneer's mindset with
innovation and business/customer buy-in before industrialization and
stabilization.
