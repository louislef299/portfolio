Title: "Tech"
---

You can find most of my tech projects on [my Github][louislef299]. If you use
AWS and would like to streamline access to your accounts, try out my [aws-sso][]
cli tool!

These articles are mostly just logs of the experiments I've done and discoveries
I've found. They are not edited very much and I don't intend to make them
consumable for the general public anytime soon. If you do want some better
references of what I'm reading from real authors, feel free to check out my
[lists on medium][].
