I've been working with my Dad(Tony) a lot to get the Little Bitta ecommerce site
up and running and successfully got [hammer-anvil.com][] up and running over the
weekend. It's a simple site and we got design inspiration from
[lovefrom.com][](thanks Jony) and *[Ma][]*. Simple yet effective design that
prioritizes mobile-first CSS principals. Details to come on that front, but it
has been pretty exciting bootstrapping Hammer & Anvil Web Services.
