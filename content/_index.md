title: About

If you're in the metro, hey! If you're out exploring, howdy. 

In a nutshell, I studied at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities and graduated in 2017 studying Computer Science. Whether it was my genuine interest or just fantastic teachers, my favorite subjects in school were operating systems, networking and general programming.

Now, I focus on distributed systems, big data and embedded engineering, but to make my life easiser, I dabble in effective CI/CD and frontend engineering. Currently employed at Medtronic.

Outside of computers, I also love to adventure and travel, however, I really suck at writing, so you'll have to bear with me. To stay active, I like to paddle on  Bde Maka Ska, backpack on the North Shore and the northern Minnesota border with my girlfriend, golf the cities with my friends, and hunt for good surf with my brother(when finances allow).

I come from a family where the cook never cleans<3
