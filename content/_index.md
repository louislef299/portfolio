Hey, my name is Louis! I'm an endurance athlete that writes code and likes to travel around the states. I began writing code at 14 years old and my imagination was instantly drawn to the unlimited possibilities of the internet. This led me to attend the University of Minnesota in 2017 for Computer Science. My interests lie around computer networks, operating systems, and open source code maintenance written in Go. 

In the professional environment, I constantly wear different hats shifting from IT support, to Solutions Architect, to DevOps engineer, to Platform Engineer into Network Engineer on any given day. My over-arching goals are to provide business value through software by reducing codebase complexity and cutting cloud costs by shrinking environment size with proper software tooling and languages. Currently, I work at Medtronic and support our Kubernetes platform.

As an endurance athlete, I was introduced to the running community at Edina High School and worked up to running varsity cross country and running at the Minnesota State Meet in 2017. In college, I decided to attend a D1 school and continue my training with my friend David Madison. Eventually, I was drawn to marathons through my interest in sports science and nutrition that I picked up from my High School coaches. In 2019, I qualified for the Boston Marathon by finishing in 2h53 at Grandma's Marathon in Duluth, but was unable to travel to the Boston race due to COVID-19. This previous summer, I had a bone spur and had to get hip surgery, halting any marathon progression I had made. This past year has been mostly focused on recovery, but I hope to be back to learning new activities this summer!

<!-- Automation can provide lots of value to engineers by abstracting some of the complexity from each task, in order to bring the barrier for entry down. This reduces the need for large amounts of high-talent engineers and increases job satisfaction to reduce stress and increase focus on the code being written. With intelligent CI/CD solutions and a push for increased local development with the prominence in container technology, developers can shrink their feedback loop in order to increase deliverable deployment speed without sacrificing quality. -->
