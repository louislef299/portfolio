title: About
---

If you're in the metro, hey! If you're out exploring, howdy.

In a nutshell, I studied at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities and
graduated in 2021 studying Computer Science. Whether it was my genuine interest
or just fantastic teachers, my favorite subjects in school were operating
systems, networking and general programming.

Professionally focusing on distributed systems, big data, security and embedded
engineering, but to make my life easier, dabbling in monitoring, frontend
design, and effective CI/CD. Currently employed at Medtronic and trying to break
my way into open source.

Outside of computers, I also love to adventure and travel, but really suck at
writing, so you'll have to bear with me. To stay active, I like to [paddle][] on
Bde Maka Ska, [backpack][] on the North Shore and the northern Minnesota border
with my girlfriend, golf the cities with my friends, and [hunt][] for good surf
with my brother(when finances allow).

I come from a family where the cook never cleans<3
