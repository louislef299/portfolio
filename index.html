travel around the world. I began writing code at 14 years old and my imagination
was instantly drawn to the unlimited possibilities of the internet, which led me
to attend the University of Minnesota in 2017 for Computer Science. Luckily, I
was able to turn my hobby into my profession and I focus on system
administration, microservices development and computer networks.</p><p>As an endurance athlete, I was introduced to the running community at Edina High
School and worked up to running varsity cross country and running at the
Minnesota State Meet in 2017. In college, I decided to attend a D1 school and
continue my training with my friend David Madison. Eventually, I was drawn to
marathons through my interest in sports science and nutrition that I picked up
from my High School coaches. In 2019, I qualified for the Boston Marathon by
finishing in 2h53 at Grandma&rsquo;s Marathon in Duluth, but was unable to travel to
the Boston race due to COVID-19.</p><p>Today, I still run from time to time, but not as rigorously as I used to. I&rsquo;ve
been turning my attention to surfing, paddleboarding(prone), backpacking,
lifting and boxing. I&rsquo;d love to have the time to compete again, but life just
got busy ever since I left college.</p><p><img src=/image/background.jpeg alt=base-photo></p></main><footer><small>2023 Louis LeFebvre | Made With ‚ù§Ô∏è and <a href=https://clente.github.io/hugo-bearcub/>·ï¶ ï ‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î·ï§</a></small></footer></body></html>
