It
doesn&amp;rsquo;t cover everything, but it at least covers the basics of where I&amp;rsquo;ve been.
A few tropical areas, lots of mountains, across the pond, all over. Very
grateful to have the opportunity to travel so much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the most impactful trips that I actually took good notes on was my
California trip last year(2023). It was just me that went, but I was pretty much
in between San Francisco and Los Angeles the whole time bumming around and
surfing. It was a blast! Luckily I got so bored that I started noting &lt;a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/hqKRLNXjLXdGLLt17">where I
went on Google Maps&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
