A few tropical areas, lots of mountains, across the pond, all over. Very
grateful to have the opportunity to travel so much.
One of the most impactful trips that I actually took good notes on was my
California trip last year(2023). It was just me that went, but I was pretty much
in between San Francisco and Los Angeles the whole time bumming around and
surfing. It was a blast! Luckily I got so bored that I started noting where I
went on Google Maps."><meta name=author content><meta name=keywords content><meta property="og:url" content="https://louislefebvre.net/travel/welcome/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Louis Lefebvre (‚úø‚ó†‚Äø‚ó†)"><meta property="og:title" content="Welcome"><meta property="og:description" content="So I‚Äôve marked up a little map to identify where I‚Äôve been and about when.

California trip last year(2023). It was just me that went, but I was pretty much
in between San Francisco and Los Angeles the whole time bumming around and
surfing. It was a blast! Luckily I got so bored that I started noting <a href=https://maps.app.goo.gl/hqKRLNXjLXdGLLt17>where I
went on Google Maps</a>.</p><p>Other than that, some spring breaks, family trips and a study abroad were all
sprinkled in there. Currently, I&rsquo;ve been watching Stoney Point up in the North
Shore on Lake Superior and have been hoping to surf it this winter. I&rsquo;ll be sure
to write up a post if I do that and maybe even get some pictures.</p><p>As much as I love traveling, I wouldn&rsquo;t say I enjoy it to just lay around and
relax. Sure I enjoy that every once in a while, but I more prefer the long road
trips across the country, wild backpacking camps up north, searching for the
best breaks on the coasts, or getting wind burn after summiting a mountain.</p><p>Anyways, I&rsquo;ll try to write up blog posts about that places I&rsquo;ve been, some of
the best restaurants I hit or some things that I did. I&rsquo;m not going to go over
any of my previous trips more than marking them on the map, but I&rsquo;ll try to
write about them a bit.</p><p><img src=/image/henry-chillin-north-shore.jpg alt="henry chillin"></p></content><p></p><p><a href='mailto:louislefebvre1999@gmail.com?subject=Reply%20to%20"Welcome"'>Reply to this post by email ‚Ü™</a></p></main><footer><small>2023 Louis LeFebvre | Made With ‚ù§Ô∏è and <a href=https://clente.github.io/hugo-bearcub/>·ï¶ ï ‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î·ï§</a></small></footer></body></html>
