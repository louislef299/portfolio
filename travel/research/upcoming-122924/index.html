I&rsquo;ll want to do a little research on each place for any camp reservations,
memberships, times of operation, suggested camping times or general
information about the area.
Upcoming Trips
San Diego, California => Ocean Beach
This January, Henry and I are flying out of MSP -> SAN and staying in a hostel
for the first half of the trip. Hopefully just catching some waves and exploring
the area a titch. One thing I should look into is if there are any paid/cheap
services to visit Anaz-Borrego State Park, but looks like you drive through
it similar to Arches. We&rsquo;re not renting a car while we&rsquo;re there so I&rsquo;ll have to
see if there is potentially a way to hop on a bus or something."><meta name=author content><meta name=keywords content="mn,north shore,"><meta property="og:url" content="https://louislefebvre.net/travel/research/upcoming-122924/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Louis Lefebvre (✿◠‿◠)"><meta property="og:title" content="Research: Upcoming Travels 2025"><meta property="og:description" content="Current list of possible and upcoming trips for 2025:

for the first half of the trip. Hopefully just catching some waves and exploring
the area a titch. One thing I should look into is if there are any paid/cheap
services to visit <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anza-Borrego_Desert_State_Park>Anaz-Borrego State Park</a>, but looks like you drive through
it similar to Arches. We&rsquo;re not renting a car while we&rsquo;re there so I&rsquo;ll have to
see if there is potentially a way to hop on a bus or something.</p><p>Otherwise, Elise will join us halfway through and we&rsquo;ll all hop over to an
Airbnb. We&rsquo;ll pretty much keep doing the same thing and maybe visit <a href=https://www.sandiego.org/explore/downtown-urban/little-italy.aspx>Little
Italy</a>. Definitely want to plan out some more ideas and take a look at the
events before we go. The <a href=https://www.ksbw.com/article/santa-cruz-california-partial-wharf-collapse/63293469>Santa Cruz wharf collapsed</a>, so the surf might be
pretty brutal.</p><h3 id=puerto-rico-family-trip>Puerto Rico Family Trip</h3><p>This is family trip that is in the works. Not quite sure on which city we will
be staying in, but just watching the flight right now on Hopper. Just need to
buy it before we go in March and then I&rsquo;m just along for the ride. Hopefully
we&rsquo;ll be able to surf, so I&rsquo;ll be sure to bring my wetsuit.</p><h2 id=possible-roadtrip-the-great-lakes>Possible: Roadtrip the Great Lakes</h2><h3 id=ski-lutsen>Ski Lutsen</h3><p>This really just <a href=https://www.lutsen.com/mountain-info/daily-snow-report>depends on snow</a>. Marked Lutsen on the map for that trip,
but will also want to go backpacking and hit those mountains if I can. Not only
could I ski, but also cross-country ski with Elise.</p><h3 id=superior-hiking-trail-glamp>Superior Hiking Trail Glamp</h3><p>Superior Hiking Trail(SHT) will happen when it gets warm enough(potentially
April?), but the idea there was Elise and I could work for a week or so while
glamping. Just hit any cabins with vacancy when we want, go camp a bit in the
trail and just <a href=https://northshorevisitor.com/business/timber-coffee-company/>coffee shop hop</a> up the North Shore. Could also camp near Ely
if we wanted to stretch it to a couple weeks and explore the Babbitt/Hibbing
area.</p><h3 id=sailing-the-great-lakes>Sailing the Great Lakes</h3><p>Registration opens up January 1st at noon for sailing classes on the <a href=https://sailmpls.org/>Minneapolis
Sailing Center site</a>. Those 420 classes fill up quickly and I want to get in
with Elise ASAP. That way I can shake the rust off for sailing and give me a bit
more practice on boat control with the smaller boats. If I get confident enough,
the goal would be to potentially rent a sail boat up north.</p><p>It looks like there are charters in Traverse City, Michigan given by <a href=https://www.greatlakessailingco.com/charters/>Great Lakes
Sailing Co</a>, that would be a bit expensive of a trip, but could be a super
memorable trip too. Will want to get more details of sailing in the North Shore
if possible, but great to see that there are links.</p><h3 id=voyageurs-national-park>Voyageurs National Park</h3><p>Elise and I had looked up <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyageurs_National_Park>Voyageurs</a> to go on a canoing trip late last fall
and learned quickly that the canoing season was shorter than we had thought.
Going to try and get ahead of it this time and try to reserve a camp site for
the spring. My thought is to just do a little 2 day canoing trip here just to
get used to canoing and then docking at islands. Not only will we have to get
the basics down, we will have to figure out all the logistics of renting a
canoe, dry bags and other materials we possibly could need.</p><p>If all goes well on that trip, I would feel confident to hit Boundary Waters
later in the summer.</p><h3 id=boundary-waters-canoe-area-wilderness>Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness</h3><p>For the <a href=https://www.exploreminnesota.com/iconic-destinations/boundary-waters>Boundary Waters</a>, I&rsquo;ll want to find the dates those reservations
open. Looks like there is an <a href="https://digital.milespartnership.com/publication/?i=834702&amp;p=12&amp;view=issueViewer">online travel guide</a>, but this one might be
tricky. Will want to know when the opening dates are(I have a hunch they already
opened), and see what kind of reservations I can make. When Dmad is back in
town, I&rsquo;ll have to see if he has the time to come with, he has quite a bit of
experience in the Boundary Waters.</p><h2 id=keeping-the-post-short>Keeping the Post Short</h2><p>In the future, I&rsquo;ll make a short little post for each of the research topics and
link them. For now, nice just to get a better idea of the idea to start thinking
them through. Budgeting for them, doing the extra research, and prepping for a
busy summer so that I take advantage of the Great Lakes!</p></content><p><a class=blog-tags href=/tags/mn/>#mn</a>
